# From Book to Code: Independent Mathematical Rigor via Lean

By combining tratitional learning with immediate formalization in Lean, I actively reinforce my understanding, discover and fix gaps, and build a robus reusable foundation of mathematical knowledge.

## What is Lean

Lean is a _functional_ programming langnage.

It involves primarily:

- types, and
- functions.

## Features

- type inference
- frist-class functions
- data types
- pattern matching
- type classes
- monads
- extensible syntax
- hygienic types
- metaprogamming
- multithreading
- verification: _you can prove properties of your functions using Lean itself_
