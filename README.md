# lean-pieces-of-mathematics

This repository hosts formalizations of content presented on my blog [piecesofmathematics.com](https://www.piecesofmathematics.com), implemented in Lean.

## Structure

The library is organized into subject-based folders, including:

- `category_theory/`
- `logic/`
- `set-theory/`
- `algebra/`
- `analysis/`
- `geometry/`
- `discrete-mathematics/`
- `number-theory/`
- `stochastics/`
- `computational-mathematics/`

Each folder contains Lean files (`.lean`).
