# lean-pieces-of-mathematics

A personal Lean library of mathematical proofs, definitions, and theorems, organized by subject. Inspired by [piecesofmathematics.com](https://www.piecesofmathematics.com), this project is both a study companion and a reference, using Leanâ€™s formal verification to ensure rigor and clarity.

## Structure

The library is organized into subject-based folders, including:

- `algebra/`
- `analysis/`
- `topology/`
- `geometry/`
- `number_theory/`
- `logic/`
- `combinatorics/`
- `probability/`
- `misc/`

Each folder contains Lean files (`.lean`) with related content, such as definitions, theorems, and proofs.

## Getting Started
